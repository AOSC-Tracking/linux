* Parallel I/O Ports

This node configures Parallel I/O ports for CPUs with QE support.
The node should reside in the "soc" node of the tree.  For each
device that using parallel I/O ports, a child node should be created.
See the definition of the Pin configuration nodes below for more
information.

Required properties:
- device_type : should be "par_io".
- reg : offset to the register set and its length.
- num-ports : number of Parallel I/O ports

Example:
par_io@1400 {
	reg = <1400 100>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	device_type = "par_io";
	num-ports = <7>;
	ucc_pin@1 {
		......
	};

Note that "par_io" nodes are obsolete, and should not be used for
the new device trees. Instead, each Par I/O bank should be represented
via its own gpio-controller node:

Required properties:
- #gpio-cells : should be "2".
- compatible : should be "fsl,<chip>-qe-pario-bank",
  "fsl,mpc8323-qe-pario-bank".
- reg : offset to the register set and its length.
- gpio-controller : node to identify gpio controllers.
Optional properties:
- fsl,qe-gpio-irq-mask : For banks having interrupt capability this item tells
  which ports have an associated interrupt (ports are listed in the same order
  as in QE ports registers)
- interrupts : This property provides the list of interrupt for each GPIO having
  one as described by the fsl,cpm1-gpio-irq-mask property. There should be as
  many interrupts as number of ones in the mask property. The first interrupt in
  the list corresponds to the most significant bit of the mask.
- interrupt-parent : Parent for the above interrupt property.

Example:
	qe_pio_a: gpio-controller@1400 {
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8360-qe-pario-bank",
		"fsl,mpc8323-qe-pario-bank";
		reg = <0x1400 0x18>;
		gpio-controller;
	  };

	qe_pio_b: gpio-controller@1418 {
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8323-qe-pario-bank";
		reg = <0x1418 0x18>;
		interrupts = <4 5 6 7>;
		fsl,qe-gpio-irq-mask = <0x01400050>;
		interrupt-parent = <&qepic>;
		gpio-controller;
	  };

	qe_pio_e: gpio-controller@1460 {
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8360-qe-pario-bank",
			     "fsl,mpc8323-qe-pario-bank";
		reg = <0x1460 0x18>;
		gpio-controller;
	  };
