There are a couple things that should probably happen before this
module is moved to fs/ and out of staging/. Most notably is the
proper documentation of how APFS/this module works. Another is the
conversion from bufferheads/pages to folios.

Another good task for newcomers is patches that make it so this
module conforms to current kernel coding standards.
